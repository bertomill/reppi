          Whatever I do with my life, great, or bad, I have 60 years. If I had one wish, it would be to make 
          the most out of my life, and that means living every moment to the fullest with courage and passion. 
          Victims make excuses. Leaders deliver results. I could lose it all tomorrow, so I'm extremely grateful 
          for all that I have.
